        <p class="lead mb-4">Having experience as a retail sales associate has helped me develop interpersonal skills by constantly communicating with customers and carrying conversations that lead to their clothing needs being met. In addition to communicating with customers, I had to be able to communicate with my co-workers and managers which has made it easier for me to feel comfortable when speaking to others or even publicly. During my time at Tillys, I was promoted to be an assistant manager which came with a learning curve. Although I had spent over a year as a sales associate and was very comfortable speaking to customers and resolving issues, I was the youngest manager in the store. Since I was the youngest, employees that were older than I was had a hard time adjusting to me being a manager, however, this did not deter me from my position. Instead, I learned how to confront employees professionally and resolve issues promptly before getting out of hand. Once I had a few weeks of experience as a manager, sales during my shifts exceeded what was expected since I kept a high moral with my employees and gave them incentives to excel.<br><br>

        The experience I had at Tillys lead me to excel when presenting myself to others in interviews since I learned interpersonal skills as well as negotiation skills. I learned that being yourself will always get you where you want to go and that lead me to find a summer internship at the University of California, Riverside. Science has always been my passion and it wasn’t until the summer internship that I realized how much I enjoyed research. I worked with a group of people funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at UCR and Keck Graduate Institute to research circadian rhythms in citrus varieties. I specifically focused on the Circadian Clock Associated 1 gene (CCA1) which should be expressed at dawn in many plants. Through this research, I learned and refined my laboratory skills of PCR, DNA and RNA isolation, RT-PCR, qPCR, transduction, vector cloning, and PCR primer design. In addition to all of these skills, I also presented in two different symposium sessions where I spoke about my summer research on circadian clock genes and I presented on an agrobusiness project that focused on using almond hulls and husks to produce ethanol as a cleaner fuel for vehicles.<br><br>

        After having a summer research experience, I sought out an undergraduate student researcher position. I then joined Dr. Tara Nordgren’s lab at the UCR School of Medicine researching how omega-3-fatty acids can reduce inflammation in the lungs due to infection/disease or irritation. However, I directly work under Dr. Arzu Ulu where we are studying the expression of protein IL-22, a cytokine that participates in modulating tissue responses during inflammation, after immediate and chronic agricultural dust exposure. Through this research, I have added immunostaining, ELISA assays, data interpretation using Fiji, lung scoring, and YM1 staining to my list of lab skills.
